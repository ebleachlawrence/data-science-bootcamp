# Variables and Control Structure Task

This is the first project task I completed using variables and control structures. 

## Requirements

Create a programme that allows the user to access two different financial calculators: an investment calculator and a home loan calculator.

1. The user should input either 'bond' or 'investment' and how the user capitalises the selection should not matter.
2. If the user inputs 'investment' they should input:
    * The amount of money they are depositing
    * The number of years they plan on investing
    * Whether it is simple or compound
    The code should then print out the answer
3. If the user inputs 'bond' they should input:
    * The present value of the house
    * The interest rate
    * The number of months they plan to take to repay the bond
    The code should then print out how much money they will have to repay each month
